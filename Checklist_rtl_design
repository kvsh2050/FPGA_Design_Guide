1. Clock and reset signals do not appear on the RHS of any always@* or assigns 
2. No clock Domain crossing occurs
3. All Combinatorial ifs have corresponding default or else 
4. All Case Options are covered and default case provided.
5. All LHS in an if/else/case appear are assigned for all conditions 
6. An LHS in an assign /always@* are an LHS only in that block
7. All seq blocks have (posedge clk) notation
8. No logic in seq block i.e, always@posedge block map directly to a flip flop from the standard cell library
9. Check combinatorial Loop, i.e, no LHS is affected by itself in RHS
10. Sysverilog logic type and always blocks. Do linter, Do synthesis.
